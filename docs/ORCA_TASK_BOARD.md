## Task handoff format

Every assignment must state:

- **Objective:** one measurable outcome.
- **Context:** relevant docs and existing implementation.
- **Dependencies:** task IDs and approved interfaces.
- **Allowed files:** exact paths or folder ownership.
- **Forbidden files:** files another agent owns or shared critical files.
- **Acceptance criteria:** observable pass/fail conditions.
- **Tests:** exact commands or manual test steps.
- **Deliverables:** code/assets/docs/report.
- **Stop conditions:** missing requirements, conflicting interfaces, destructive action, or scope expansion.

## Status definitions

`NOT STARTED` → `IN PROGRESS` → `BLOCKED` or `IMPLEMENTED` → `TESTED` → `REVIEW REQUIRED` → `COMPLETE`.

Only Agent 1 may mark a cross-agent task `COMPLETE` after review. An agent must not claim a task is complete because code was merely generated.
